    audience: "CFO or financial executive"
    word_count: 138

    content: | 
      Your costs are climbing and margins are under pressure. You’re asked to do more with less—and everyone’s watching how you’ll respond.

      What’s worse, your sales team isn’t helping. They’re discounting to win deals, which erodes the very margins you're trying to protect. That’s not just frustrating—it’s dangerous. It puts more pressure on finance to make the numbers work when the top line isn’t strong enough.

      We believe you should expect more from your revenue team. They should support margin growth, not hurt it. That’s how modern sales should work.

      The Priority Sale helps your sellers get in earlier, when value matters more than price. They’ll build high-margin deals that support your bottom line, not shrink it. They’ll ask better questions, uncover real problems, and sell based on impact.

      When sellers do that, you protect your margins—and prove your value.
    evaluation:
      type: "good"
      strengths:
        - Clear threat tied to finance's goals
        - Strong pain-to-threat-to-relief structure
        - Emotionally resonant without jargon

      Backlogs keep growing. Customers are frustrated. And inside your walls, people are burned out from trying to do too much with too little. You’re doing everything you can to hold the line—but it’s not sustainable.

      At the same time, sales keeps selling more. But they aren’t asking the right questions up front—so you inherit messes that could’ve been avoided. Promises get made that your team has to figure out how to keep.

      We believe your operation deserves better upstream support. Sales should make your job easier, not harder.

      With The Priority Sale, sales learns to understand your customers and your capacity before they promise the world. That means fewer headaches for you—and more profitable work that your team can deliver with confidence. You’ll spend less time firefighting—and more time leading your team to success.
    evaluation:
      type: "good"
      strengths:
        - Addresses cross-functional pain (sales > ops)
        - Clear belief/relief framing
        - Strong “you” focus and narrative tone

      Your business requires revenue. Hitting your goals is never easy. It certainly is costing a lot to do. And while you’re probably making sales, you might wonder if your sales team is doing a lot of high-value selling.

      If not, you’re getting caught in the race to the bottom, where price is all that matters. That means smaller margins, tighter budgets, and real questions about whether your business is viable for years to come.

      We believe you deserve to work with customers who know and respect the value you give them. And when you do, your margins will grow.

      The Priority Sale is designed to lift your team out of the race to the bottom. They will learn how to get into deals earlier, with real decision-makers who appreciate your value. With this approach, they will make higher-margin deals that grow your business. You’ll hit the goals you’ve set—and stay competitive in a margin-compressed world.

    word_count: 154

      Managing compliance across legacy systems is a full-time job—and you already have one. Miss one audit trail, and you’re in the headlines. Regulators don’t care that your team is stretched thin or that your systems are outdated. The risks are real, and they’re growing.

      Your team is capable, but the tools aren’t helping. They’re patching together reports, chasing down logs, managing spreadsheets, and spending hours validating records—when they should be solving problems and enabling progress.

      We believe compliance should be a strength, not a scramble. It should build trust, not fear. And it should support your strategy—not distract from it.

      The Priority Sale helps you elevate IT’s role by ensuring upstream sales align with downstream compliance requirements. Our managed services proactively connect your systems with evolving frameworks. That means fewer surprises, cleaner audits, and more time for meaningful, high-value work.

      Let’s turn compliance from a burden into a business advantage—so you can lead with clarity, confidence, and control.

      Finding good people isn’t easy. You post, you wait, and you hope the right person applies.
