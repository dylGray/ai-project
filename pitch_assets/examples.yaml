    content: | 
      Your costs are climbing and margins are under pressure. You’re asked to do more with less—and everyone’s watching how you’ll respond.

      What’s worse, your sales team isn’t helping. They’re discounting to win deals, which erodes the very margins you're trying to protect. That’s not just frustrating—it’s dangerous. It puts more pressure on finance to make the numbers work when the top line isn’t strong enough.

      We believe you should expect more from your revenue team. They should support margin growth, not hurt it. That’s how modern sales should work.

      The Priority Sale helps your sellers get in earlier, when value matters more than price. They’ll build high-margin deals that support your bottom line, not shrink it. They’ll ask better questions, uncover real problems, and sell based on impact.

      When sellers do that, you protect your margins—and prove your value.
    evaluation:
      type: "good"
      strengths:
        - Clear threat tied to finance's goals
        - Strong pain-to-threat-to-relief structure

    content: | 
      Backlogs keep growing. Customers are frustrated. And inside your walls, people are burned out from trying to do too much with too little. You’re doing everything you can to hold the line—but it’s not sustainable.

      At the same time, sales keeps selling more. But they aren’t asking the right questions up front—so you inherit messes that could’ve been avoided. Promises get made that your team has to figure out how to keep.

      We believe your operation deserves better upstream support. Sales should make your job easier, not harder.

      With The Priority Sale, sales learns to understand your customers and your capacity before they promise the world. That means fewer headaches for you—and more profitable work that your team can deliver with confidence. You’ll spend less time firefighting—and more time leading your team to success.
    evaluation:
      type: "good"
      strengths:
        - Addresses cross-functional pain (sales > ops)
        - Clear belief/relief framing
        - Strong “you” focus and narrative tone

      Your business requires revenue. Hitting your goals is never easy. It certainly is costing a lot to do. And while you’re probably making sales, you might wonder if your sales team is doing a lot of high-value selling.

      If not, you’re getting caught in the race to the bottom, where price is all that matters. That means smaller margins, tighter budgets, and real questions about whether your business is viable for years to come.

      We believe you deserve to work with customers who know and respect the value you give them. And when you do, your margins will grow.

      The Priority Sale is designed to lift your team out of the race to the bottom. They will learn how to get into deals earlier, with real decision-makers who appreciate your value. With this approach, they will make higher-margin deals that grow your business. You’ll hit the goals you’ve set—and stay competitive in a margin-compressed world.

      Your goals are relentless. The demand, always the same. Sell more. Yet prospects are making things hard. They ignore you. When they do talk, all they want is a lower price.

      You might start to wonder if there’s any future in this. When you’re getting pressure from both sides, it’s easy to feel stuck.

      We believe you shouldn’t have to feel that way. You deserve better tools to sell in today’s environment—and a process that supports you.

      The Priority Sale was built for today. It's a fresh approach to selling that places you higher up, earlier in the sale. It’s a place where price doesn’t matter, but solving problems does. You’ll make higher-value sales, gain confidence, and feel in control again.
    evaluation:
      type: "good"
      strengths:
        - Tailored to seller's pain points
        - Strong emotional language
        - Clear connection to priority and relief

    reading_level: "4th grade"
    content: |
      Your team is building a great product—but win rates are falling. It’s not a product problem. It's a timing problem.

      By the time your reps get in, the deal is shaped. And shaped by someone else. That means you’re stuck reacting to someone else’s vision—one that doesn’t play to your strengths.

      We believe you deserve a sales team that influences—not reacts.

      The Priority Sale helps your reps get in early, before buyers build their list. They’ll connect to strategic problems and earn influence with real decision-makers. They’ll shape the deal around your strengths—your product, your story, your value.

      And it doesn’t stop there. With this approach, your team builds trust faster, earns access to bigger budgets, and gets ahead of price-driven bake-offs.

      More wins. Higher margins. Better deals.

      Your product deserves a smarter sales strategy. The Priority Sale builds the habits that get you there—consistently, and at scale.
    evaluation:

      strengths:
        - Emphasizes timing and influence (compressed time)

    content: |
      Managing compliance across legacy systems is a full-time job—and you already have one. Miss one audit trail, and you’re in the headlines. Regulators don’t care that your team is stretched thin or that your systems are outdated. The risks are real, and they’re growing.

      Your team is capable, but the tools aren’t helping. They’re patching together reports, chasing down logs, managing spreadsheets, and spending hours validating records—when they should be solving problems and enabling progress.

      We believe compliance should be a strength, not a scramble. It should build trust, not fear. And it should support your strategy—not distract from it.

      The Priority Sale helps you elevate IT’s role by ensuring upstream sales align with downstream compliance requirements. Our managed services proactively connect your systems with evolving frameworks. That means fewer surprises, cleaner audits, and more time for meaningful, high-value work.

      Let’s turn compliance from a burden into a business advantage—so you can lead with clarity, confidence, and control.

      Finding good people isn’t easy. You post, you wait, and you hope the right person applies.

      Meanwhile, you’re losing time. Teams are stretched thin and burning out. Morale dips. And top candidates get hired before you even speak to them.

      We believe hiring shouldn’t be a waiting game. You deserve a process that’s proactive—not passive.

      Our platform helps you connect with top talent before your competitors do. Instead of waiting on resumes, you’ll reach out directly to qualified people based on real insights.

      You’ll fill roles faster, boost team performance, and avoid costly delays. Better yet, your hiring managers will have confidence in every candidate they speak to.

      Stop waiting. Start hiring with momentum.

      Your leadership wants proof. But all you have is noise.

      Meanwhile, your competitors are making smarter moves. They're capturing market share while you're stuck explaining why last quarter's numbers don't tell the whole story. Every budget meeting feels like a defense instead of a victory lap.

      We believe marketers deserve clarity—not chaos.

      Our analytics tool shows you what matters most—so you can prove ROI and win the budget battles. You'll walk into meetings with confidence, armed with insights that actually make sense. No more scrambling to justify your spend or wondering if your campaigns are working.

      Instead of drowning in data, you'll be surfing on insights. Your leadership will see results they can understand and believe in.

      Stop defending. Start proving.

      Then you lose the deal—to someone who showed up later, but got taken seriously. Your quota is slipping. Your manager is asking questions. And that commission you were counting on? Gone to someone else's pocket.

      Meanwhile, your competitors are closing deals faster because they know which prospects are ready to buy. They're not wasting time on tire kickers.

      We believe you shouldn't be punished for doing the hard work.

      The Priority Sale gives you tools to find better deals, sooner. You'll know which prospects are hot before you drive across town. You'll walk into meetings with buyers who are ready to sign, not just browse.

      You'll stop chasing and start leading.
    evaluation:
      type: "ok"
      strengths:
        - Good rhythm and empathy
        - Easy to speak aloud
      weaknesses:
        - Relief feels vague
        - Slightly short and lacks threat depth
      improvements:
        - Clarify the consequence of “missing the deal”

    content: |
      You've rolled out new tools, new content, new tech. But nothing seems to stick.

      Sellers revert to what they know. Coaching doesn't land. And leadership asks why nothing's changing.
      Meanwhile, your competitors are seeing real adoption. Their reps are actually using new methodologies and closing more deals. Your investment in enablement feels wasted while their teams are pulling ahead in the market.

      Every quarter, you launch another initiative. More training sessions, more resources, more "game-changing" platforms. But your sales metrics stay flat. Your reps nod in meetings, then go back to their old ways the moment they're on calls. We believe enablement should drive change, not chase it.

      The Priority Sale helps reps internalize a new way to sell—one that aligns with how buyers buy. Instead of overwhelming them with more tools, we help them master the fundamentals that actually move deals forward. Your reps will embrace change because it makes their jobs easier, not harder.

      So you'll stop pushing tools and start building habits.
    evaluation:
      type: "ok"
      strengths:
        - Relevant to enablement

      improvements:
        - Trim and make stakes clearer

      Reps are missing quota. Forecasts are slipping. You’re under pressure to make up ground—fast. You’ve invested in tools, training, and talent, but results still lag behind expectations. Leadership wants answers. The board wants numbers. Meanwhile, your team feels overwhelmed and under-equipped.
