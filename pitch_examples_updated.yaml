    \nWhat\u2019s worse, your sales team isn\u2019t helping. They\u2019re discounting\
    \ to win deals, which erodes the very margins you're trying to protect.\n\nWe\
    \ believe you should expect more from your revenue team. They should support margin\
    \ growth, not hurt it.\n\nThe Priority Sale helps your sellers get in earlier,\
